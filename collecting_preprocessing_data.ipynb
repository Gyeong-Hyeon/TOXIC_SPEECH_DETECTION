Because it takes a trashy low quality human to produce more trashy low quality humans you tend to get pockets of these spring up in specific \"community bubbles\" as they tend to be self rewarding - for example if your entire family is like this then they put direct pressure on everyone else they come in contact with in that neighbourhood/area to also conform to that type of behaviour which has a cumulative effect if other trashy families are also present.

            "1. Disney princesses have been heavily criticized by actual feminists for as long as the two have existed. Just because the SJW crowd is suddenly getting into it doesn't mean they're wrong. \n",
            "2. \tThen again, what makes you say feminists are automatically right? ACTUAL feminists include women who wanted black people's voting to never happen, men to be reduced to 10% of society and said all penis-in-vagina is automatically rape. It's not like we are talking about a group that exists therefore is right. \n",
            "3. \t\tI didn't say they're automatically right.. I said that they're right in this situation. The message of The Little Mermaid is quite literally to give up absolutely everything that you are in order to find \"the perfect man\". Ironically the original fairytale had the exact opposite message, to learn to be comfortable with who you are instead of relying on other people to make you happy. Cinderella was again about how you aren't worthy until you change your appearance and demeanor.  What's funny is something like Aladdin which was a gender swap of the same premise, ultimately ended with the message being not to lie, but instead to be yourself.  Beauty and the Beast was about legit stockholme syndrome. Fall in love with abusive assholes just because it's better than being single. The hardworking Gaston is considered an ass for all of his negative traits, the Beast, whose accomplishments are a result of birth-rite, does all of the exact same negative shit, but he's considered a good guy.  What shocks me is feminists who don't spot these glaring problems, but instead blindly support Disney. \"The Force is Female\" is a marketing slogan, not a philosophy. And where did you get your \"ACTUAL\" feminists? You're talking about extremists. Extremists are never a good thing and are almost always a minority. For every Andrea Dworkin there are 20 non-vocal, even-tempered feminists. For every Roosh-V there are 20 normal non-sexist MRAs.\n",
            "4. \t\t\tHow many stories are about men giving up everything and risking it all for being with the perfect woman, protecting her, caring about her, etc.? I'm not saying it should be the rule of law, but for many people that's how they want to be and how they are. Now you will say because muh society, but it has always been that way. You don't have to like it. But if you deny that risking everything for love is something people do, then you are being disingenuous.   With Cinderella you should also consider that the prince loved her even when he found out what she really was. Like you can't ignore the fact they had no chance at meeting otherwise.      Aladdin is completely different, though. He literally created a whole, complex lie with stories made up of his deeds. Like there is a whole song of the Genie going around and saying outright lies about him. He created a whole new persona, while Cinderella just went to the ball.      Belle only started liking the Beast once he started being nicer. She hated and feared him when he was mean. Girl kept trying to get away from him. It's again, disingenuous to say she fell in love with him.    Both him and Gaston started out as dickbags, but the Beast was willing to work on himself and become a much better person. Gaston, even to his last moment was an aggressive person and refused to listen to Belle. Even with Maurice, while the Beast imprisoned him at first, he exchanged him for Belle, then also let even her go when Maurice was ill.    To me one of the big themes of the movie is how you can change, better yourself and set things right if you try. (I think one song in the movie even has lyrics along those lines.)       The feminists I talked about? Elizabeth Cady Stanton   > Elizabeth Cady Stanton (November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902) was an American suffragist, social activist, abolitionist, and leading figure of the early women's rights movement. Her Declaration of Sentiments, presented at the Seneca Falls Convention held in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, is often credited with initiating the first organized women's rights and women's suffrage movements in the United States.[1][2] Stanton was president of the National Woman Suffrage Association from 1892 until 1900.        Sally Miller Gearhart    > Sally Miller Gearhart (born April 15, 1931) is an American teacher, feminist, science-fiction writer, and political activist.[1] In 1973, she became the first open lesbian to obtain a tenure-track faculty position when she was hired by San Francisco State University, where she helped establish one of the first women and gender study programs in the country.[2] She later became a nationally known gay rights activist.      And Andrea Dworkin, whom I probably don't have to introduce at all.   Conveniently, she is the only one who is considered a radical feminist, though not at all a little fringe no-name nobody.    Please, do the typical thing and declare that the biggest of big name organisers or feminism are totally not actual feminists. Because YOU know what feminism REALLY is about, somehow Emmeline Pankhurt (suffragette and also white feather movement supporter), Germaine Greer (influential second-waver and also supporter of female-on-male pedophilia) or Marion Zimmer Bradley (celebrated feminist fantasy author and habitual incestuous child rapist) were not real. None of them actually are, just you. \n",
            "5. \t\t\t\tJesus! Fuck you're nutty. You've read into my statements as if I'm somehow in support of internment camps for men. You're just as fucking nuts as those lunatics. Go fight your gender war somewhere else.  &#x200B;  We're talking about whether the stories reinterpretted by Disney are sexist or not, not whether other stories are sexist or whether some feminists are batshit crazy. Establishing that good things will only happen for you when you literally give up on who you are is damaging. What I literally said is that they're not wrong to say that Disney has pushed some pretty sexist messages in their media in an attempt to profit. They care about women's right about as much as Obama. Hint: They don't, they just like to talk about it.\n",
            "6. \t\t\t\t\t> What I literally said is that they're not wrong to say that Disney has pushed some pretty sexist messages  Or they are movies in which people like you decide to read sexist messages into. People read into pieces of art the things that they want to see. That's why great works are always so discussed and analyzed. Everybody has a different perspective. Unless Disney explicitly says what their message is, it's just your interpretation being imposed on them.\n",
            "7. \t\t\t\t\t\tI just said this to someone else, but.... Disney princess movies are advertised to extremely young children. Not middle aged women. A middle aged woman somehow being manipulated by some shitty disney movie probably has more to worry about than \"the big bad media\". A 6 year old though? Her first interpretation of male/female relationships is one of pure fantasy. Generally speaking boys at the same age are watching adventure movies/shows like Transformers, Ninja turtles or Pokemon. They're about making friends, having a good time and being morally right. Shows advertised to girls(at least back in the 80s-90s) are generally about finding the right guy.\n",
            "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t>Disney princess movies are advertised to extremely young children. Not middle aged women.  So? Kids who watch Superman don't usually try to jump off the roof with a towel around them.  Even kids can grasp the nature of reality.  >Her first interpretation of male/female relationships is one of pure fantasy.  Actually it would be his/her parents and family members.  >Shows advertised to girls(at least back in the 80s-90s) are generally about finding the right guy.  Jem, My Little Pony, She-Ra, Punky Brewster, Strawberry Shortcake, would all disagree with you.  What shows were you talking about exactly?  And how is this a sexist message anyways? If it's what girls like and want to see.\n",
            "9. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI'm certain I could find a ton of stories of kids being stupid with makeshift capes. That's not the point though. The point is that kids absolutely do want to emulate Superman's morals. They use those stories as a way of determining how they act around others. A story about a very fantastical interaction is going to create an idea of fantasy. I'm sure little girls want to become mermaids, the same as boys want to become superman, the difference is interpersonal relationships.  Generally speaking a familial relationship is viewed entirely differently. A kid generally doesn't watch their parents go on dates, they don't watch their parents fall in love. Even those with a broken household still aren't sitting in on their mother's date with suitor #2. The nuance of attraction is being simulated with camera work and sound in movies and tv shows.  Kids are attracted to colors, not so much stories. Designing a story with pink colours but doesn't feature a relationship is absolutely doable and I don't think people take issue with it. It's the shows that are pink in colour and are pushing some tumultuous, romantic subplot that become a problem. Boy Meets World is about a kid, his brother and best friend screwing around. Season 3 introduces a romantic subplot that's treated in a fairly healthy way throughout the rest of the series. Girl Meets World is about a girl and her best friend dealing with dramatic relationships right from day 1.\n",
            "10. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThose goal posts are getting pretty hard to make out from here.  >A story about a very fantastical interaction is going to create an idea of fantasy. I'm sure little girls want to become mermaids, the same as boys want to become superman, the difference is interpersonal relationships.  Fantasy is not reality. Even children know this.  Interpersonal skills are learned from interacting with other people. Not from watching media. no one, even kids emulates these characters in real life. Unless you hace evidence otherwise?  >Generally speaking a familial relationship is viewed entirely differently. A kid generally doesn't watch their parents go on dates, they don't watch their parents fall in love.  No. But they do watch them kiss, hug, interrelate, see how they manage conflicts etc.  This is their first experience with relationships, despite what you claimed.  I can still kind of see that goal post creeping back.  >Kids are attracted to colors, not so much stories.

Please, do the typical thing and declare that the biggest of big name organisers or feminism are totally not actual feminists. Because YOU know what feminism REALLY is about, somehow Emmeline Pankhurt (suffragette and also white feather movement supporter), Germaine Greer (influential second-waver and also supporter of female-on-male pedophilia) or Marion Zimmer Bradley (celebrated feminist fantasy author and habitual incestuous child rapist) were not real. None of them actually are, just you.\", \"Jesus! Fuck you're nutty. You've read into my statements as if I'm somehow in support of internment camps for men. You're just as fucking nuts as those lunatics. Go fight your gender war somewhere else.  &#x200B;  We're talking about whether the stories reinterpretted by Disney are sexist or not, not whether other stories are sexist or whether some feminists are batshit crazy. Establishing that good things will only happen for you when you literally give up on who you are is damaging. What I literally said is that they're not wrong to say that Disney has pushed some pretty sexist messages in their media in an attempt to profit. They care about women's right about as much as Obama. Hint: They don't, they just like to talk about it.\", \"> What I literally said is that they're not wrong to say that Disney has pushed some pretty sexist messages  Or they are movies in which people like you decide to read sexist messages into. People read into pieces of art the things that they want to see. That's why great works are always so discussed and analyzed. Everybody has a different perspective. Unless Disney explicitly says what their message is, it's just your interpretation being imposed on them.\", 'I just said this to someone else, but.... Disney princess movies are advertised to extremely young children. Not middle aged women. A middle aged woman somehow being manipulated by some shitty disney movie probably has more to worry about than \"the big bad media\". A 6 year old though? Her first interpretation of male/female relationships is one of pure fantasy. Generally speaking boys at the same age are watching adventure movies/shows like Transformers, Ninja turtles or Pokemon. They\\'re about making friends, having a good time and being morally right. Shows advertised to girls(at least back in the 80s-90s) are generally about finding the right guy.', \">Disney princess movies are advertised to extremely young children. Not middle aged women.  So? Kids who watch Superman don't usually try to jump off the roof with a towel around them.  Even kids can grasp the nature of reality.  >Her first interpretation of male/female relationships is one of pure fantasy.  Actually it would be his/her parents and family members.  >Shows advertised to girls(at least back in the 80s-90s) are generally about finding the right guy.  Jem, My Little Pony, She-Ra, Punky Brewster, Strawberry Shortcake, would all disagree with you.  What shows were you talking about exactly?  And how is this a sexist message anyways? If it's what girls like and want to see.\", \"I'm certain I could find a ton of stories of kids being stupid with makeshift capes. That's not the point though. The point is that kids absolutely do want to emulate Superman's morals. They use those stories as a way of determining how they act around others. A story about a very fantastical interaction is going to create an idea of fantasy. I'm sure little girls want to become mermaids, the same as boys want to become superman, the difference is interpersonal relationships.  Generally speaking a familial relationship is viewed entirely differently. A kid generally doesn't watch their parents go on dates, they don't watch their parents fall in love. Even those with a broken household still aren't sitting in on their mother's date with suitor #2. The nuance of attraction is being simulated with camera work and sound in movies and tv shows.  Kids are attracted to colors, not so much stories. Designing a story with pink colours but doesn't feature a relationship is absolutely doable and I don't think people take issue with it. It's the shows that are pink in colour and are pushing some tumultuous, romantic subplot that become a problem. Boy Meets World is about a kid, his brother and best friend screwing around. Season 3 introduces a romantic subplot that's treated in a fairly healthy way throughout the rest of the series. Girl Meets World is about a girl and her best friend dealing with dramatic relationships right from day 1.\", \"Those goal posts are getting pretty hard to make out from here.  >A story about a very fantastical interaction is going to create an idea of fantasy. I'm sure little girls want to become mermaids, the same as boys want to become superman, the difference is interpersonal relationships.  Fantasy is not reality. Even children know this.  Interpersonal skills are learned from interacting with other people. Not from watching media. no one, even kids emulates these characters in real life. Unless you hace evidence otherwise?  >Generally speaking a familial relationship is viewed entirely differently. A kid generally doesn't watch their parents go on dates, they don't watch their parents fall in love.  No. But they do watch them kiss, hug, interrelate, see how they manage conflicts etc.  This is their first experience with relationships, despite what you claimed.  I can still kind of see that goal post creeping back.  >Kids are attracted to colors, not so much stories.
