      "2. \tGetting away with it for their entire lives.  Like a badly trained dog or a toddler that is never punished correctly they learn this behaviour through lack of consequences.  The blame thusly lays squarely at the feet of their family unit (dysfunctional/fatherless/abusive/etc), their direct social circle (friends, co workers and people they studied with) and then only indirectly at the people they surround themselves with in their wider community and society.  Because it takes a trashy low quality human to produce more trashy low quality humans you tend to get pockets of these spring up in specific \"community bubbles\" as they tend to be self rewarding - for example if your entire family is like this then they put direct pressure on everyone else they come in contact with in that neighbourhood/area to also conform to that type of behaviour which has a cumulative effect if other trashy families are also present.   TLDR - this is learned behaviour. \n",
      "3. \t\tHave you noticed that you typically see more of this type of behavior from females than males?  Do you think that it's because some parents are 'easier' and more indulgent on girls? Or is it bacause some people think they can bully their way into getting what they want because a vast number of people these days are afraid of confrontation?  I'm the mother to a teenage boy and if he ever even thought about acting like this he would not enjoy the consequences.  I agree with you 100% this behavior is learned at an early age.\n",
      "4. \t\t\tParrents are **100%** more relaxed on their female children. (This is coming from a 16 year old male with two brothers and two sisters)  So many times in the past my mom and dad have been very relaxed, and a lot less likely to jump to harsh punishment toward my sister's even if what they did was pretty bad. As well, my parents for some reason let my older sister get a smartphone at like 13, but I didn't get one till I was 15. :/\n",
      "5. \t\t\t\t>Parrents are **100%** more relaxed on their female children.   Bull fucking shit. I got punished for everything I did wrong and for some things I didn't even do. I have 3 brothers and 2 sisters and the boys in my family were treated like gold. As the oldest of my full-blooded siblings (2 younger brothers), I was afforded luxuries before them because I was older, not because of some pussypass shit. Untwist your perceptions, my dude.\n",
      "6. \t\t\t\t\tMy father and mother loved beating the shit out of me physically and emotionally, but my sisters were treated like they'd been touched by Midas himself. It's almost like all families are different and perhaps people shouldn't interpret other people's experiences through their own lens. Just because the kid up there said it's 100&#37; true doesn't mean it is.\n",
      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\t>Just because the kid up there said it's 100&#37; true doesn't mean it is.  Right. That's exactly what I was trying to convey. Every family is different and to make blanket statements like PC did is not helpful and is just untrue.  I'm truly sorry about what happened to you as a child. No one should have to endure that.  EDIT: changed OP to PC (parent commenter)\n",

I would expect nothing better from the shambles which is the current state of the New York Times.
